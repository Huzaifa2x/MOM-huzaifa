SCOUT DRONE DESIGN REVIEW – 06/08/2025
Meeting Time: 8:30 PM – 10:15 PM
Objective: Optimization of the Scout Drone with emphasis on weight reduction, cost efficiency, and thrust-to-weight balance.

---

Key Changes and Discussions:

1. Structural Weight Refinement:
   The initial structure weight was approximately 1700g, which was too high for our performance goals. The team has reduced the wheelbase and shortened the rotor arm length, leading to a significant drop in frame weight. The updated structure is now expected to weigh around 450g.

2. Powertrain Optimization:
   The earlier motor, MN5008, has been replaced with MN4006 to better match the reduced frame weight and achieve the desired 2:1 thrust-to-weight ratio. This motor is lighter while still delivering the required thrust.
   The ESC has been replaced with a 4-in-1 ESC (Pro III – 55A – 6S – 50g), which helps reduce wiring complexity and space usage. This change is also aligned with the updated battery configuration, which has been changed to 6S.

3. Battery and Power Budget:
   The battery selected is a 6S, 12Ah pack weighing 1 kg. It provides sufficient current for the drone's operations while maintaining system balance. The total current consumption is estimated at 45A, which is within the safe limits of the ESC.

4. Propulsion System:
   The drone will use 14x4.8 carbon fiber propellers, each weighing about 20g. These are well-suited for the MN4006 motor and offer efficient thrust for scouting missions.

5. Avionics and Payload:
   The combined weight of propulsion and avionics is around 700g. The payload, which includes the speaker, is approximately 1 kg. With the structural weight estimated at 450g, the drone is expected to remain within acceptable total mass limits.

6. Cost Considerations:
   The overall budget should be maintained under ₹1,00,000. Major savings are expected from the switch to the 4-in-1 ESC and optimized motor selection.

To-Do:
Dhruv will complete the calculations and revised weight table by tomorrow.
Simulation tests will be conducted to validate the new motor, ESC, and battery configuration.
Thermal profiling for the ESC under expected load conditions will also be prepared.
