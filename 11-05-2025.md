### 7:00 - 8:30 PM

1. Speakers presented thier respective ideas.
2. Discussion on various tech. aspects
3. Sponsorship
4. CAD modelling lead: Dhurv & Huzaifa

## Task assigned: 

1. Tabulate all configuration discussed. Analyze pros & cons for each config. Discuss with peers.

2. Finalize Configuration Selection : 15/05/2025.

3. CAD models (Production ready): 25/05/2025.

## Speaker #1: Dhruv

A hexacopter setup or a quadcopter frame with eight motors mounted on both sides of each arm. This configuration is chosen for improved stability and better weight distribution, making it suitable for applications where enhanced balance and performance are required despite added structural complexity.

## Speaker #2: Rakshita

The scout drone uses a quadcopter VTOL design for hover and scanning area, while the delivery drone employs a hexacopter VTOL setup, offering greater lift capacity to carry payloads efficiently. Both configurations ensure stable hovering, with the hexacopter optimized for heavier loads and the quadcopter for speed and maneuverability.

## Speaker #3: Huzaifa

A tricopter setup, focusing on speed and a lightweight scout drone. Balance between stability is agility.

## Speaker #4: Vrishank

Diving into the specifics - An automated system, working Parallelly with both drones & sync both drones. 

4G LTE module/5.8 GHz analog video transmitter with ground reciever. 

## Discussion:

A 2 - in - 1 drone, capable of both scouting & delivery. Reduce time to & fro from the launch site, spliting delivery 50-50 between each drone.

**Question**: What if multiple volunteer bunch up at a spot? How many payload per geotagged location ?

## Speaker #5: Spoorti

Manual v/s autonomous flying. Penalties for manual flying

## Discussion: 

Backup Batteries, changing batteries mid operation 

## Speaker #6: Vaishnav

Technical section; 

Rasberry Picamera

Geotag location -> GPS Module

Normal microController -> Takeoff & landing 

ESP 32 specs: In-built wifi, bluetooth & Magnetometer

Teensy 4.1 specs: (more preferrable choice) A very powerful micrCcontroller; Minimum clock speed: 600 mHz

In-built SD card slot, abundant amount of RAM -> making data log-in easy; containing 55 pins

## Discussion:

Compatibilty issues b/w Rasberry Pi & Pixhawk.

Subodh Bhaiya's point on " **Making** **the** **drone** is the difficult part, autonomy is easy". Pixhawk is plug n play

KML file contents: containing geographic data,  map constraints
