### Review of ideas presented on 11/05/2025:

| Idea | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| Quadcopter frame with 8 motors attached on both sides | Too complex; Not necessary for our mission |
| Quadcopter VTOL Configuration | Consumes lot of power while hover; Complexity in making VTOL design |
| Tricopter Configuration | Looks small and simple; But the set up is complex |
| Thermal Camera | Too expensive |

## Proposed Solution: 

### Scout Drone:

1. Quadcopter configuration
2. Camera: 4K electroptic; facing downwards

### Delivery Drone:

1. Quadcopter cnonfiguration
2. should carry all 10 payloads at once.



## Sponsorship:

Sponsors will be more interested in "Bill of Materials" than the CAD models.

### Before making CAD models:

1. Prepare Bill of Materials.
2. Attain Preliminary weight from the Bill of Materials.
3. Create CAD models.

## Indianization: 

Use as much "Made in INDIA" products as possible. Will be a + point in business pitch presentation.
