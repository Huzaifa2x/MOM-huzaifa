### Objectives:
1. Build 2 Autonomous drones.
2. Locate and Geotag the survivors.
3. Deliver the payloads.

### Requirements: 
1. Dimension limits: 6 x 6 feet, 25 kg
2. COTS materials must not be used in drone manufacturing.
3. Use Delicensed Frequency
4. Implement the fail safe features:
5. Maintain autonomy through-out the mission timeline. Manual control of the drone will result to penalty.
6. Deliver the payloads

### System Architecture:
| Component | Scout Drone | Delivery Drone | Proposition |

## Workflow 

### Pre-mission: (5 min)
1. Load KML file with predefined flight path and spacing for the scout drone.
2. Ensure all failsafe features are enabled:

     i) Return To Base (RTB)

     ii) Battery threshold set to 15%

     iii) Geofence limits

     iv) Altitude restrictions

### Phase 1: Scanning & Geo-Tagging
1. Scout drone takes off from launch pad and climbs to operational altitude.
2. Follows the predetermined path at set speed.
3. On spotting a Survivor:
   
     i) Geotag the location (using onboard GPS and camera integration).

     ii) Trigger the speaker to communicate with survivor.

     iii) Log geotagged data into the database and transmit it to the delivery drone for action.

### Phase 2: Payload Delivery
1. Delivery drone takes off upon receiving geotagged coordinates.
2. Cruises to the target location.
3. Descends to 20 ft above ground.
4. Drops payload at the specified geotag.
5. Fetches any new geotags from the control station.
6. Returns to base (RTB) if no further geotags recieved.


## Up For Discussion:

### Cameras:
1. Arducam 64 MP (10 - 11) K
2. Rasberry pi gloibal shutter cam (9 - 10) k
3. Arducam high quality 12 MP
4. arducam 16MP autofocus

### Visual Inertial Odometery
   Rasberry pi 5

   IMU sensor - BNO08x

   Algorithm- OpenVINS - compatible with rasberry Pi
  
   Communication - MAVROS 
  
### LIDAR 
### Auto - arming the drone
### Centre of Gravity for payload drone
### Loitering Mode for Delivery drone
